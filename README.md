# The_ice_cream_retail_shop

#### in this project the customer had a lot of products and wanted to answer a few related questions which are :
#### 1. Explore and visualise (in Tableau) the sales performance of the three consumer groups (students, staff and tourists).
#### 2. Sales staff believe that different groups of flavours sell better at different times of the year. Explore if the data backs this up (or not). Identify appropriate flavour groupings and visualise them to generate insights into the ice cream sales. 
#### 3.  Analyse if grouping the flavours gives a better level of analysis than individual flavours? If so, what groups do you suggest? 
#### 4.  What outliers can be identified from the daily sales? Describe the outliers and give possible explanations. 
#### 5.  Create a written report of 500-1000 words, including visuals and explanation in each case, in answer to each question.
